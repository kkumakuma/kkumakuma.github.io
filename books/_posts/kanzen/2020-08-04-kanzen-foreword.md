<h1>Foreword</h1>
This book meticulously talks about the different methods of suicide.

This book, however, is neither a report on those who have killed themselves, nor is it an attempt to explain the reasoning behind those who commit suicide.
Although one can read this book for leisure, the general direction of this book is on "how to commit suicide".

With such a winding opening, perhaps you are already bored.

Nobody knows just how long it's been since the question of "Why do young people wish for death?" arose. Since then, it has been a topic of much debate. Even so, certain conclusions could be reached. For instance, in the 70s, the generally accepted reasonings were "nihilism", "difficult times", and the like. But for questions such as "Why is one not allowed to commit suicide?" and "Why must one continue to live?", there is yet to be an answer.

Coming back to the issue at hand, there still needs to be a book that can allow suicide to come to fruition.

In regards to such a book, the one published ten years ago, titled "Suicide Methods", was merely full of irrelevant content that bores the reader. What there needs to be now, is a book purely on the different methods of suicide.

In America, a researcher had invented a suicide device that allows for death by euthanasia (Case 30). This book is the only one in Japan that is a suicide device through the use of words.

At this point, I would honestly prefer to just start with the introduction of suicide methods by medicines, but for the sake of providing a greater understanding of "Why would one wish to commit suicide?" and other reasons of the trade, I am left with no choice but to write some more.
