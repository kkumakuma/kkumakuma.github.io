<h3>Foreword</h3>
This book meticulously talks about the different methods of suicide.

This book, however, is neither a report on those who have killed themselves, nor is it an attempt to explain the reasoning behind those who commit suicide.
Although one can read this book for leisure, the general direction of this book is on "how to commit suicide".

With such a winding opening, perhaps you are already bored.

Nobody knows just how long it's been since the question of "Why do young people wish for death?" arose. Since then, it has been a topic of much debate. Even so, certain conclusions could be reached. For instance, in the 70s, the generally accepted reasonings were "nihilism", "difficult times", and the like. But for questions such as "Why is one not allowed to commit suicide?" and "Why must one continue to live?", there is yet to be an answer.

Coming back to the issue at hand, there still needs to be a book that can allow suicide to come to fruition.

In regards to such a book, the one published ten years ago, titled "Suicide Methods", was merely full of irrelevant content that bores the reader. What there needs to be now, is a book purely on the different methods of suicide.

In America, a researcher had invented a suicide device that allows for death by euthanasia (Case 30). This book is the only one in Japan that is a suicide device through the use of words.

At this point, I would honestly prefer to just start with the introduction of suicide methods by medicines, but for the sake of providing a greater understanding of "Why would one wish to commit suicide?" and other reasons of the trade, I am left with no choice but to write some more.

<h4>Chernobyl</h4>
I have always been waiting for the Second Coming. 20 years ago, during the student riots, everyone had thought "The reckoning is coming!". With the Apollo moon landing, the oil crisis, the Soviets invading neighbouring countries and the Showa era coming to an end, I had thought "This time, it's really happening." And in the end, it was just a magnitude 3 earthquake that lasted only to the end of the apartment block. The students had looked at each other with smiles on their faces, said "Wasn't that amazing?" and that was the end of that. (Excerpt from the postscript of "Dawn")

Towards the end of the 80s, there was a collective wave of opinions featuring the idea that "the world is going to end". Dangerous topics became the widespread focus of conversation, the most popular bands came singing the songs of Chernobyl, children's jokes were laced with the shadow of death and young women began searching for partners in preparation for Armageddon. "The reckoning is coming!" "The world is ending tomorrow!" We were all terribly excited.

And yet, the world didn't end. The atom bomb never dropped, and all the dreams of a full-scale nuclear war had completely disappeared. The revolutionaries of the 80s had the misfortune to experience this frustration first-hand.

In the end, everyone finally came to terms with the fact that the reckoning was never going to happen, and that the 22nd century was eventually going to come. (Of course, the 21st century was also going to come, since Armageddon was not coming). The world was definitely not going to end. It is hard to feel satisfied with such a brief taste of "the Underworld" and the "Outside". Of course, if we really wanted a little more excitement, if we really wanted the world to end, we could always do "that thing".

<h4>A Long Vacation</h4>
It is unavoidable to say things like "It's boring." We were simply unlucky enough to be born into this stage of history.

Up until the 22nd century, we repeat the same whimsical nonsense day in, day out- we wake up at 7 in the morning, then commute to school or to work. At school, we rote learn English phrases and historical era names countless time after countless time. At work, we do the same boring tasks whilst saying "This is so boring" day after month after year in an endlessly repeating cycle.

Slowly but surely, new state-of-the-art products are produced. Slowly but surely, politicians keep working their corrupt ways. Slowly but surely, the content on TV continues to provide excitement for their viewers. And yet, when I flick the switch, turn off the TV and look around, it is still the same mundane everyday. (Waking the reader up to the "wonderful darkness that comes with turning off the TV" is another goal of this book).

In his autobiographical novel "Masked Confession", Yukio Mishima wrote that "everyday life" is more terrifying than war. It takes all of us just to endure the "trembling horror of everyday life" so we can bring about a meaninglessly "peaceful future". Every step along the way, we must carefully avoid any deviations on this path to our future. After all, there is no 'happy ending' like the ones we see in a TV serial. And yet, a warped state of "happy" slowly but surely continues to exist. Yes! The key words are "slowly" and "surely". The same things, repeating constantly, endlessly over time; such monotony is the first element that instigates the will to die.

<h4>Another Brick in the Wall</h4>
In 1978, there was a case of “Suicide by Ghost Leg”. A pair of 10th grade twin sisters living in Toyama Prefecture had been found in the forest, having hung themselves. In one of their notebooks, there was a maze pattern formed by four vertical lines and numerous interlacing horizontal lines (a game of finding the goal by following the lines). Underneath the pattern, there were the incomprehensible writings of “Japanese people’s X”, “suicide”, “ROS” and “three families”. Upon following the lines, one would inevitably arrive at their “suicide” location. As neither of their parents could understand their motive behind their suicide, it was concluded that they committed suicide because of the “Ghost Leg”. It is said that “ROS” could have stood for “Rolling Stones”. Along with “Japanese people’s X”, “I hate Asians” was also written. It is probable that these two statements had some sort of connection. However, it is impossible to determine what these words really mean.

A long time ago, a judge had said, “Human life is more important than Earth itself.” Of course, this is an absurd misconception. Just as the two high school girls had noticed in the 70s, human life is unimportant. In fact, they are as trifling as the phrases “Japanese people’s X” and “ROS”.

In the late 50s, popular American sociologists had said, “The masses are like grounded atoms.” In the late 70s, an English rock band sang the massive hit “We are a brick in the wall.” And yet, even upon entering the 90s, the situation in Japan has not changed a bit. The same as ever, we remain a powerless brick in the wall. The proof remains in the fact that if any of us die, another will certainly come to replace us. There is nobody who is irreplaceable. Not even a politician is worth assassinating. If only one brick is missing from a wall, it will not collapse.

The fact is that each of us is powerless, it does not matter whether we exist or not. In other words, life is unimportant. This is the second element that instigates the will to die.

<h4>Clockwork Orange</h4>
As we live on repeating the same old whilst embracing this feeling of powerlessness, we slowly start to forget the “feeling of really living”. Eventually, we become unable to tell whether we are dead or alive. Just what exactly is the feeling of “I’m alive”? Right now, the difference between living and dying is separated by a line so thin, it is almost invisible.

This is why words such as “Life is important, so you mustn’t kill yourself”, “if you live, then surely good things will come”, or “the others around you will be sad, so you ought to keep living” no longer hold any weight. Words that could prevent suicides have long been rendered ineffective, as situations permitting suicides have appeared.
Yes, it is fine to die. If you go to school or work, detest living, think it is boring, or even so far as painful, then perhaps it is better to cross the thin line between life and death. No-one can stop it after all.

As I have said before, even if one were to live, nothing would change. It does not take someone with ESP to be able to predict, albeit generally, what would happen to the world, and to oneself. No matter how convincing cries of “The future, the future!” may seem, it is pointless. Your life, perhaps, consisted of going to a local primary and middle school, then travelling to cram schools to study for the high school entrance exams. You would have then gone to high school, university, played around for 4 years and entered a company for work. For men, you would have been married before 30, having children every other year. You would have changed countless jobs and positions before eventually reaching the rank of manager. At 60, you would retire and live life at your own pace for about 10 or 20 years, and then die. That would be it. And yet, this is considered the most reassuring, ideal life that we so desperately wish for.

Under such circumstances, life no longer holds any grand meaning. Perhaps it is not living, but rather “being born” for a purpose much like a broiler chicken’s. Therefore, cutting life short at a suitable moment is not a matter of “extreme sadness” or “there will be no second chance” or “worrying over it causing a ripple effect”. Suicide is rather a very positive course of action.

<h4>Angel Dust</h4>
Amongst my friends, I knew someone who would, no matter where he went, wear a little silver metal capsule on a necklace. Inside was an extremely strong drug that, when ingested, would cause the person to fall into a disoriented state, allowing them to peacefully jump off a high-rise building. This was called “Angel Dust”. He said, “If things become bad, I can take this to kill myself.” My friend did not have a stable job, and lived every day comfortably.

I hope this book can become something to another what that little silver capsule was to my friend.
