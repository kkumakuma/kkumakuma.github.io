<div class="smalltext">*If you can manage to do it successfully, there is no better way to die. The main trouble is that many of the available options do not always work. This method can also cause severe agony.*</div>

Red, blue and yellow. Scattered on the table are pretty tablets and capsules of varying colours. There might even be a small pile of white powder. If you were to ingest even a little, you would fall asleep and never wake up again. Death eventually comes as a form of extended sleep. This is the most ideal method of suicide, and is also only attainable through the use of medicines.
Some types of medicine can control the mind. The brain is a self organising system responsible for controlling the entirety of the human body. From breathing to heartbeat regulation, the brain manages all functions required to maintain life. To explain further, when the brain loses its ability to coordinate itself upon ingesting these types of medicine, the body is no longer able to support life. As such, this method could be better classified as a technique for self-lobotomy.

####Medicine That Does Not Kill Is Not Medicine At All
No matter what type of medicine we are talking about, there will always be an “effective dose”, a “toxic dose” and a “lethal dose”. There are experts who say that “medicine that does not kill is not medicine at all”. There is no type of medicine that is incapable of killing. It is just that there is a significant difference in the amount needed to be effective and the lethal amount. In order to reach the fatal dose, a large amount of medication needs to be taken, but this is the only real difficulty in using medicine to kill. Most modern medicines have a wide margin between these two amounts. In other words, they can be considered safe medicine. The medicines which I am going to introduce have only a fine line between efficacy and lethality.
However, the problem lies in the numbers of such a “lethal dose”. The standards written in this book are taken from various different cases found in literature, but the “lethal dose” itself varies greatly between them. There is also the fact that to kill, the required dose can change significantly across certain individuals. Depending on factors such as the person’s constitution or how often they ingest certain medicines, there have been many cases of people being revived after taking amounts well into the lethal dose, as well as people dying from taking only a small amount.

What should be a nice neat number bordering life and death is often only merely indicative due to the vast conditional differences amongst individuals. As such, some researchers say that if you really want to die, you should take 3 times the lethal dose. In this sense, the “lethal dose” can no longer be considered a “lethal dose”. For the sake of this book, all “lethal doses” (all unspecified amounts are adult doses) used are an average between the minimum and maximum doses known to cause death, and as such is to serve only as a guideline. The ambiguity of this “lethal dose” not only shows the tentativeness of the boundary between life and death itself, but is also the main reason as to why it is so difficult to commit suicide through medicine.

Although I have said this much, I still need to say a bit more. Cutting your wrist open a little will not outright kill you, but all of the medicines listed in this book will actually kill you. So if you really want to have a taste of suicide (which is not always a bad thing), it is probably better to just cut your wrist.

####To Throw Up, Or To Die
The most important thing is to avoid vomiting the ingested medicines back out again. Committing suicide by medicines is, after all, getting acute drug poisoning. In fact, it is easier to imagine having a drink. Of course, you cannot exactly just die from ingesting alcohol, but that does not mean it is impossible to die from it. Here and there we will hear of cases of university students dying from alcohol poisoning. In this case, we are simply changing the concept from alcohol to medicines. However, it is the body’s natural response to vomit when it can no longer handle what is being taken. Therefore, it is rather difficult to find the middling amount required.

There are however, certain ways to reduce the chances of vomiting the ingested toxins back up. One way is to strengthen the digestive organs’ ability to absorb chemicals, much like what one would undergo in symptomatic therapy. Unfortunately, there is no concrete way to respond to vomiting, as it is a physiological reaction. In any case, in order to attain the required lethal dose, one has no choice but to take more than what is necessary.

####Halcyon Will Not Kill You
An important thing to note is to know the lethal dose of a particular medicine before attempting to ingest it. There are many medicines out there which can kill you. For the sake of this discussion, we will be referring to the sleeping pill known as ‘Halcyon’. On the surface, it seems a rather dangerous medicine as it causes rapid onset of drowsiness and may have amnesic side effects. However, it is in fact, very safe. A 27 year old woman had swallowed 80 tablets of Halcyon with alcohol and had fallen asleep. She later climbed out of bed in a trance, much like a sleepwalker, and told her parents “I’m going to Lawson”, after which she fell down. She was immediately admitted to hospital. When the test results came back the following day, they were completely normal. As such, merely seeming dangerous is not quite enough to kill.

This book does not cover medicines with an unknown lethal dose. Without proper planning, any attempts will not only not kill you, but also saddle you with further unnecessary suffering. A housewife who had ingested an insufficient amount of potassium cyanide had spent the entire night clawing at her chest. When she was discovered in the morning, her bloodied chest was near unrecogniseable.

By the way, many of the rumours surrounding suicide by medicine are completely false. Many people tend to say that medical suicides result in serious lifelong problems in the internal organs and brains that will never heal. But from looking at the medicines listed in this book, many doctors have said there are no such side effects.   

There are also “anti-suicide advocates” who claim that health insurance will not cover injuries sustained from suicide attempts, and so treatment will be extremely expensive. This is also not true. A 26 year old woman was admitted to hospital after swallowing unknown quantities of an unknown drug. The hospital equated it to having ingested 20 tablets and 20 packets of their strongest available sedative. She was comatose for two days following her admission, but was able to use her healthcare card to pay for her treatment. Therefore, it is also important to not be deceived by false rumours.

####Intravenous Injection
First of all, there are many alternative methods that can bypass vomiting. The easiest way would be to heat the medicine over a fire on something like aluminium foil, or by dissolving it in hot water so it becomes an aqueous solution. This can then be injected into a vein via a syringe. In this case, vomiting is not only impossible, but as the absorption ability of the bloodstream is greater than the gastrointestinal system, a much lesser amount of medicine is required. If air ends up getting mixed into the syringe, air embolism can occur in the brain and will also cause death. If there are foreign bodies in the syringe that end up in the bloodstream, the body will go into shock, which is another potential cause of death. However, this also results in considerable pain in the blood vessels. As multiple injections can cause severe pain, measures should be taken to decrease the suffering, for example, applying cold compresses to your arms. It is better to come up with some ways of reducing this pain beforehand.

####Pay Attention To Your Last Supper
For those unwilling to utilise intravenous injection and simply want to ingest the medicine, they should adjust the contents of their stomach beforehand. In order for the medicine to be absorbed quickly and effectively enough to cause acute drug poisoning, there needs to be no food left in the stomach. However, if the stomach is completely empty, ingesting these foreign chemicals will induce vomiting faster than normal. Finding a balance between these two states is difficult.

1 hour before you intend to commit suicide, you should drink a cup of black tea and eat a slice of toast. Taking motion sickness medicine is fine as well. For tablets, they should be put into a blender and ground into a powder. Capsules should either be opened to obtain the powder inside, or dissolved in hot water.

This should then be mixed into something easy to eat, such as pudding or yoghurt. Add some honey and then eat it quickly. There are, however, some experts who say that ingesting these medicines via pudding or yoghurt does not help speed up absorption in the body. Perhaps it is better to take this as a way of making the medication easier to ingest.

####Drinking Alcohol At The Same Time
Taking pills with alcohol is a prerequisite. It is said that since alcohol has an effect on the central nervous system, it synergises well with the intent of drug absorption. It can accelerate the speed at which any medicine is dissolved and absorbed into the body and increase the effects by 50%. It is probably also a good idea to prepare enough other non-alcoholic drinks as well.

The next step is to find somewhere where you will not be found. You should ensure that you will not be discovered for at least 8 hours, in which case, a hotel room could be ideal. If you are found within 8 hours, however, the situation becomes a suicide attempt. You will be forced to ingest water and throw up multiple times, and have your stomach pumped. Unless you wish to try enduring the suffering of such an ordeal, you should stick to the recommended time frame.

A 25 year old woman was subjected to stomach pumping as a result of attempted suicide. She said, “I wouldn’t have tried to commit suicide if I knew it would end in so much pain.” (But she also said, “Maybe I’ll try it again.”)

Since we have now made the necessary preparations, I will start introducing the medicines that you can use to commit suicide.
